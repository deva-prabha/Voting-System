# Voting-System
This is a voting system, that the voters can vote for their candidate and shows the result of the election
1st we can give what are the nominees that we want to keep
then initially the vote count will be 0 for both nominees.
And the voter ids are give as 1 to 10, then here we calculate the number of voters as the lenth of of the voter id(here it is 10)
In this system we use the while loop, then the vote is in the voters id they can vote and if not they couldnt also we rae remving the already voted voter from the list like the voter id so if a person already voted cannot vote again.
And the voting is like if we select a person to vote if it is 1st nominee then press 1 and if 2nd then press 2.
then we have session like to check the voting list is completed, then
we calculate the each of their percent of voting and decide the winner
if they are having same votes the gov.is deciding who  is the winner!!
